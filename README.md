 Medieval Online Store Ecommerce

 Almost finished... or so I thought, 'till I realized this is not responsive <strong>AT ALL</strong> so now
 I have to fix that, but I'll do it later down the line cause there's some other stuff I wanna work on and 
 finnish. Also I need to add an actual shopping cart... I kinda forgot about that, but I'll add it in the next couple days, gotta make the site responsive first.

 Pending features: 
 + Responsiveness 
 + ADD A SHOPPING CART
 + Improve functionality
 + Add more content
 + Fix footer
